# Image-Captioning
Image Captioning Show, Attend and Tell (SAT)
The purpose of Image Captioning Show, Attend and Tell (SAT) is to automatically generate descriptions of images using a novel attention mechanism.
# Generate human-like captions: 
Unlike previous models that relied solely on image features, SAT aimed to create captions that resembled natural language descriptions humans would produce. This included capturing details, objects, relationships, and even actions within the image.

# This introduces an attention based image caption generator. 
# The model changes its attention to the relevant part of the image while it generates each word.

This figure form the original paper gives a short explanation of the network's structure.
